            <h1>01 • Tone & Voice</h1>
            <p>The difference between voice and tone is that a voice is how we speak to others, much like any person's unique voice and style. A tone is how we project our feeling at any given time. Tone can also change depending on the circumstance, environment, or the party you are talking to.</p>
            <h2>Tone</h2>
            <p>The language should be pretty informal and friendly, as if you were talking to a good friend, genuinely trying to help them through a problem. Never belittle or catch the user off guard with anything. At all times, when choosing between being entertaining and being transparent, always go with the latter.</p>
            <p>Be mindful that the tone can change depending on the stage of the user journey through the app experience. For example, you can have an informal tone at the start of a user's journey – casual browsing and information gathering.</p>                
            <p>You can be a bit more formal when booking an appointment with an agent, confirming details, or reminding users of necessary upcoming meetings.</p>                
            <p>Technical errors, such as server lags, crashes, or input errors, should be handled carefully and tactfully. Be friendly and let the user down gently!</p>
            <h2>Voice</h2>            
            <p>We go out of our way to help the user find the best solution for them in the least amount of time and effort. We remember details (from their profiles) and present relevant information. At all times, we should always adopt a mentality of service first.</p>
            <p>Our writing style is upbeat at all times. We make finding a home more accessible and empower others to do it independently with the best possible information available for every property.</p>
            <p>When we make suggestions, we remember how many places they’ve seen, bookmarked, inquired about, and suggest relevant results. </p>

                <h1>02 • Colors</h1>
                <p>The primary color for the brand is Deep Blue. The accent color is a Gold Yellow. Together these colors invoke a feeling of trust and groundedness, with a hint of prestige and happiness.</p>
                <p>Several shades of gray differentiate body text from inactive text and provide subtle hints of visual hierarchy.</p>
                <p>These colors are used throughout the mobile and web app to ground the experience while calling specific attention to items of importance. These include confirmation dialogue boxes or calls to action such as signing in and out. </p>
